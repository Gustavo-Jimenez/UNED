# About this folder

## What is this?
The files found here pertain to courses within the UNED (Universidad Estatal A Distancia) of Costa Rica, they will show the path towards fluency and efficiency within the University, I do this to keep track of my own academic progress, as well as a way for others to see and understand the abilities I have.

## Why are the files in Spanish?
As part of them being university courses, they need to be written in Spanish, I've no way around this, if you are interested in me translating any part of it to English please reach out to gustavojimenez@uned.cr and I'll try to translate the code comments as well as the README.md of the files.

## Who am I?
I'm a Business Intelligence Engineer with 4 years under my belt, with deep experience on SQL Systems, however, I saw a need to have deeper understanding of compilers, and other operations in the area, in order to keep improving myself I started the diploma in Informatics, which I hope to later enhance into a Bachellors and finally I'd love to know more about areas like **AI** from scratch, not only AWS System calls which I've done, but more in depth understanding of Neural Networks, tokenization, etc...

# Is this current?
The last update of this folder was made on **September 28, 2025**. Once uploaded I don't think I'll be updating the files unless I see a critical error after revision.
